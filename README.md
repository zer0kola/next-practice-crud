# Next.js TypeScript CRUD Project

This is a side project built to study CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using Next.js with TypeScript. The backend is powered by Supabase, and the project leverages React Query for data fetching and caching. A simple Todo list application was implemented to demonstrate CRUD operations.

## Features

- **Next.js with TypeScript**: The project is built using Next.js, a popular React framework, with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
- **Supabase Backend**: Supabase is used as the backend to handle authentication, database management, and API routes.
- **Server Actions**: The project utilizes Next.js's server action feature for handling server-side operations efficiently.
- **React Query**: React Query is used to manage server state, providing an easy way to fetch, cache, and sync data in the frontend.

## CRUD Implementation
The project implements basic CRUD operations through a Todo list:

- Create: Add new tasks to the Todo list.
- Read: View all tasks from the Todo list.
- Update: Edit existing tasks.
- Delete: Remove tasks from the list.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js
- TypeScript
